        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you're adding onions,leeks,ot other chopped veggies, give them a quick saute first.</li>
        <li>Prep you deep-dish pie pan (or tart pan) with pie dough for a single crust.We're going to "blind bake" the quiche crust before pouring in the filling.</li>
        <li>To blind bake the crust, line your crust with aluminum foil,shaping it so it fits the crust,
            all the way to the edge .To weigh down the foil,fill the foil with dried beans or Pie
            weinght if you're fancy,distributing them across the bottom and partly up the side.The 
            weight helps hold the crust's shape.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the crust in a preheated 425 degree F oven for 7 minute. Carefully remove the foil and the weight.Then return the foil-free curst to the oven for another
            5 minutes. For more on tis technique,check out how to blind bake a pie crust.
        </li>
        <li>Nor for the filling! we're using three whole eggs plus two extra egg yolks. Whisk 
            together the eggs with cream and milk until well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Next, layer your fillings into the crust. First, lay down two-third of your sauteed
            veggies and two-thirds of your cheese. Carefully spoon in your creamy egg mixture. Top
            with the remainder of your fillings.Because balancing an uncooked quiche from counter
            top to oven can be challenging, here's a simple no-mess tip: Pull out an oven rack and 
            place a sheep pan on it; put the pie curst on the pan, spoon the egg mixture into the crust,
            and then gently pust the rack into the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Place in a 325 degree F oven until the egg mixture sets, about 40 minutes. You want it to 
            just set. Watch the video above to see how chef John judges when his quiche is perfectly set.
        </li>
        <li>Let your quiche cool before slicing and serving</li>
